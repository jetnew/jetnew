ðŸ˜Š Hi! I'm currently building Atlas (https://atlasworkspace.ai), an AI workspace to transform ideas into insights.

ðŸ•¶ I'm Director at AgentScale AI (agentscale.ai), an award-winning AI automation agency that has delivered 30+ AI solutions, from MVPs for startups to business-critical live deployments for MNCs.

ðŸ’» I'm an AI engineer working on the intersection of AI agents, RAG and prompt engineering. As a founder, I believe that LLMs can help use learn things, do things and create things.

ðŸ’¼ Previously, I worked as:
- Founder at AgentScale AI (2023 - Present): AI automation agency
- Data Scientist Intern at Indeed (2022): Data science at scale
- Student AI Researcher at NUS (2021): Transformer and reinforcement learning research
- Machine Learning Engineer Intern at Grab (2021): ML engineering at scale

ðŸŽ“ I graduated in CS from the National University of Singapore in 2023 as top student in machine learning.

ðŸ«¡ Still here? Reach out! I'd love to hear about your work too.
