### Founder / Data Scientist

🕶️ Hi! I’m building Large Language Model (LLM) agents to help businesses scale at [AgentScale.ai](https://agentscale.ai/).

🎓 I graduated in CS from the [National University of Singapore](https://www.comp.nus.edu.sg) in 2023, with both ML engineering and AI research experience.

💼 I previously worked as:

* Data Scientist Intern at [Indeed](https://www.indeed.jobs) (2022)
* RL Research Student at [NUS](https://clear-nus.github.io) (2021)
* Machine Learning Engineer Intern at [Grab](https://www.grab.com/sg) (2021)

🧠 I run AI Space, an AI community in Singapore with 600+ people, e.g. at Google Developer Space.
