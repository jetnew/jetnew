### Data Scientist / Machine Learning Engineer

💻 Hi! I’m a computer science fresh grad from the [National University of Singapore](https://www.comp.nus.edu.sg). I did AI research in the [Turing Research Programme](https://www.comp.nus.edu.sg/programmes/ug/cs/tp) and multidisciplinary studies at the [University Scholars Programme](https://www.usp.nus.edu.sg).

🕶️ I’m currently building Large Language Model (LLM) agents to scale business processes at AgentScale.ai.

💼 I previously worked as:

* Data Scientist Intern at [Indeed](https://www.indeed.jobs) (2022)
* RL Research Student at [NUS](https://clear-nus.github.io) (2021)
* Machine Learning Engineer Intern at [Grab](https://www.grab.com/sg) (2021)

🧠 I run [AI Space](https://t.me/joinchat/Nd3pOKrmU2EwYTU9), an AI community in Singapore with 600+ people, to meet new people with similar interests in AI. Previously, I led the [NUS Statistics & Data Science Society](https://sites.google.com/view/nussds) student club as president.
