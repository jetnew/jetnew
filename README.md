### Computer Science @ National University of Singapore

ðŸ’» I study computer science, and enrolled in the [University Scholars Programme](https://www.usp.nus.edu.sg/) (USP) at the [National University of Singapore](https://www.comp.nus.edu.sg/) (NUS).

ðŸ§  My current research interests include reinforcement learning, multi-agent systems, evolutionary algorithms and causality.

ðŸ“ˆ I lead the [NUS Statistics & Data Science Society](https://sites.google.com/view/nussds) as president, organising technical workshops and events such as the annual Data Science Competition.

ðŸ’¼ I was previously AI undergraduate researcher at [CLeAR Lab](https://clear-nus.github.io/) (2021) and interned as a machine learning engineer at [Grab](https://www.grab.com/sg/) (2020) and [IMDA](https://www.imda.gov.sg/) (2019).
