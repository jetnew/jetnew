### AI Engineer

☁️ Hi! I'm building Atlas: AI reader for the web. My goal is to help everyone leverage the full capabilities of LLMs.

💻 I'm an AI engineer working on the intersection of RAG, agents and knowledge graphs. I believe that LLMs can help us learn things, do things and create things.

💼 Previously, I worked as:
- Co-founder at AgentScale AI (2023): Research, Engineering, Product, Design
- Data Scientist Intern at Indeed (2022): Data science at scale
- Student AI Researcher at NUS (2021): Transformer and reinforcement learning research
- Machine Learning Engineer Intern at Grab (2021): ML engineering at scale

🎓 I graduated in CS from the National University of Singapore in 2023 as top student in machine learning.

🧠 I run AI Space, an AI community in Singapore with 600+ people, e.g. at Google Developer Space.
