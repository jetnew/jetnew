ðŸ˜Š Hi! I'm currently building Autocratic (https://autocratic.ai), an AI workspace for agencies to automate client work.

ðŸ’» I'm an AI engineer working on the intersection of AI agents, RAG and prompt engineering. As a founder, I believe that LLMs can help use learn things, do things and create things.

ðŸ’¼ Previously, I worked as:
- Founder at AgentScale AI (2023 - Present): AI automation agency
- Data Scientist Intern at Indeed (2022): Data science at scale
- Student AI Researcher at NUS (2021): Transformer and reinforcement learning research
- Machine Learning Engineer Intern at Grab (2021): ML engineering at scale

ðŸŽ“ I graduated in CS from the National University of Singapore in 2023 as top student in machine learning.

ðŸ«¡ Still here? Reach out! I'd love to hear about your work too.
